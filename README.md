# Sample Cassandra REST-API

### Installation

Install and start Cassandra.
By default a local single node on localhost is assumed. You can also connect to a cluster.
If you want to connect to an external node or cluster, see [_configuraton_](#configuration) section
```
cassandra -f
```
Install depemndencies with [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
```
pipenv install --dev
```

And then launch the API
```
pipenv run server
```
The description of the endpoints can be seen at the root of the server for instance:
(http://localhost:5000/) where the individual endpoints can be opened and tried out. Both Cassandra and the server needs to be running.


## <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration
The default configuration settings are located in `example_config.cfg`.
The settings can be overriden by pointing the environment variable `FLASK_APP_CONFIG_FILE` to a similar config file.


# Testing

## Unit testing and ci-testing
For Unit testing, run:
```
pipenv run test
```
The tests come in two parts: unit testing with pytest, and api testing using `tavern-ci`
which tests the REST-endpoints. Both are run by pytest using the previous command.
Unit testing uses its own "testing" keyspace which is reset every run, the api testing uses the development keyspace that the flask app
is also uses locally.

## Verification

Get sample data to the project root folder:
```
wget https://cdn.example.com/sample_data.jsonl.bz2 -O - | bunzip2 > sample-data.jsonl
```
Download the [sample data]( https://cdn.example.com/sample_data.jsonl.bz2) and place it as `sample_data.jsonl`  in the root folder of the project.
Import a couple of thousand of them by running. This is not mandarory for unit testing but for [verifying](http://localhost:5000/) that the apis work and for the travis-ci part of the tests it is needed.
```
pipenv shell
python tests/prepopulate.py sample-data.jsonl 10000
```

Go to [the api docs](http://localhost:5000/) and use the "try out" section for the different endpoints

# Technologies used

The services is built on top Flask and Flask-resplus, a lightweight Python framework for building REST-apis and webservices.
The connection to Cassandra nodes is done via the python-driver for Cassandra and via Flask-CQLAlchemy.
Flask-CQLAlchemy provides an nice integration to the Cassandra models provided by python-driver.
The actual database models are described using Model classes (in app/models/) that desctibe the Cassandra tables.
a sync command generates the Cassandra tables.

## Cassandra tables
The tables, which were generated by the Cassandra python-driver can be seen in a generalized form here:
```
CREATE KEYSPACE player_sessions WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '3'}
AND durable_writes = true;

CREATE TABLE player_sessions.completed_sessions_by_player_id (
    player_id uuid,
    session_id uuid,
    end_ts timestamp,
    country text,
    start_ts timestamp,
    PRIMARY KEY (player_id, session_id, end_ts)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (session_id ASC, end_ts DESC)


CREATE TABLE player_sessions.session_starts_by_country (
    country text,
    daybucket text,
    start_ts timestamp,
    player_id uuid,
    session_id uuid,
    PRIMARY KEY ((country, daybucket), start_ts)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (start_ts DESC)


CREATE TABLE player_sessions.session_events_by_player_id (
    player_id uuid,
    session_id uuid,
    ts timestamp,
    event text,
    country text,
    PRIMARY KEY (player_id, session_id, ts, event)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (session_id ASC, ts DESC, event ASC)
```
